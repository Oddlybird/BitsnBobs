# BitsnBobs
Town name generator, maybe evolving into something more

To Do: 
- Give blobs names from the generator
- Create data structure to record and track information about each blob as their features grow in complexity
- Create function to list all neighbors of a given blob
- Create function to test whether two arbitrary blobs are neighbors or not.
- Begin implementing nobility, population units, guilds/families of note, nested land claims, and fealty

Changelog : 


Initial Upload: 
- Reviewed Transport Tycoon's english town name generator, compared it with wikipedia's list of english towns and cities, did some analysis, and bodged something together.  Also spent a good while tweaking the quality-control function and percentage chances, for optimal results.
- Created a (very inefficient?) blob-generator, which will lay out irregularly shaped and sized counties / land parcels on a loose grid.
- Assorted small blob-related functions that will be useful later
